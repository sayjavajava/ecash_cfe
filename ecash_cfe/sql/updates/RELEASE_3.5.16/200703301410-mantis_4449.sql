'Your loan is always due on your paydays.  By receiving a loan through US Fast Cash you agree that your loan will be renewed until you request otherwise.  What this means is that you will pay the interest fee (only) on this due date.  If you loan is renewed, you do accrue a new interest fee. You can renew your loan four times. On the FIFTH renewal, you must pay the interest fee plus pay down your balance by $50.00. (EXAMPLE:  for a $300.00 dollar loan the fee is $90.00.  On the 5th renewal, you pay $140.00 = the $90.00 fee plus the $50.00 pay down. The next time you want to renew, your balance will be $325.00. After your fifth renewal, your loan must be paid down every due date until it is paid out.)  You will receive an account summary via email two weeks before each due date.  If you want to pay down on the principle of your loan or pay out your loan, initial the appropriate box, sign and return the document to us via fax or email.  You must return your document to us 3 full business days prior to your due date.  That means that if you are due on Friday, we need to have this document by Tuesday. '
